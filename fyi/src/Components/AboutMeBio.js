            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I loved growing up on a small farm in a
            small town. I was a happy little girl and loved the
            <br />
            animals, especially the horses and my cow named Moo. The fresh air,
            the dusty ground and
            <br />
            the casual farm-life were my comfort. Then I started school. I
            noticed the other kdis around
            <br />
            me and realized my siblings and I looked different and were treated
            with disregard. Sometimes,
            <br />
            we were teased and left out. It felt awful and I didn't feel so
            happy anymore. I began to
            <br />
            observe and study what the respected and esteemed children did
            differently. I began asking
            <br />
            myself a few questions.
          </p>
          <br />
          <ol>
            <li>
              What was it that made people attractive and automatically
              accepted, before they even said
              <br />a word?
            </li>
            <li>
              How did they get other people to pay attention and listen to their
              ideas?
            </li>
            <li>
              What was it that these kids did that gave them the confidnce?
            </li>
            <li>
              And what was it that caused the opposite effect? What was causing
              me to be disregarded
              <br />
              and left feeling so badly?
            </li>
          </ol>
          <br />
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I began to see the contrast in our image;
            dress, grooming, etiquette, and body language. I<br />
            recognized the clothing I wore, effected how I felt about myself and
            about my day. As time
            <br />
            went on, I realized that some outfits, hairstyles, etc., made me
            feel embarrassed and I just
            <br />
            wanted to hide and remain invisible. Other more fashionable
            ensembles were empowering. I<br />
            felt unstoppable, confident, like a million bucks.
